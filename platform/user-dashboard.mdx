# User Dashboard

The **User Dashboard** is your control center on NotNoise. When you log in, you land on the dashboard page, which is organized into a few main sections accessible via tabs or menu.

## Dashboard Sections

### Smart Links

Manage your Smart Links here. This tab lists all the smart links you've created, along with summary info for each (like total views or clicks, and quick-action buttons). You can create new links from here, edit existing ones, copy their URLs, view analytics, or delete them.

By default, this is the first section you'll see on the dashboard. Each Smart Link entry provides quick access to:
- Copy URL button
- Edit icon
- Analytics icon (Pro only)
- Social Media Asset icon (Pro only)
- Delete icon

### Email Subscribers

This section shows the table of fan emails you've collected (if you have enabled Email Capture on any links). It's only visible if you're Pro (since free users cannot collect emails). Here you can review subscribers and export the list as described in the [Fan Email Capture](/features/email-capture) section.

<Note>
  If you click this tab and you're a Free user, NotNoise will prompt an upgrade since collecting emails is a Pro feature.

### Playlist Promotions

This is the tab for Spotify Playlist Campaigns. It lists any campaigns you have in progress or completed. For each campaign, you'll see:
- The track name
- Status (Active, Delivered, etc.)
- The date created
- Action buttons:
  - If it's Active or Delivered, a **View Campaign Report** button
  - If it's still Payment Pending, options to resume payment or cancel the campaign

A **New Campaign** button is present to start a fresh playlist promotion.

### Account/Settings

In the top-right corner (usually an avatar or email menu), you can access your account settings:
- Update your profile information
- Manage your subscription plan (upgrade to Pro, update billing, etc.)
- Logout

## Dashboard Features

### Dashboard Stats

At the top of the Smart Links section, you might see some **Dashboard Stats** summarizing your activity, like:
- Total link views across all links
- Total clicks
- Average CTR
- Other metrics to give a big-picture health check of your marketing

### Sorting and Filtering

There's a sorting feature for the Smart Links list: you can sort by newest, oldest, most views, most clicks, highest CTR, etc., using a dropdown. This lets you quickly find your top-performing link or see which older links might need a boost.

### Pro Feature Access

Throughout the dashboard, if you attempt to use a Pro feature on a free account, NotNoise will show an **Upgrade to Pro** modal. Examples:
- Trying to create more smart links beyond the free limit
- Clicking Email Subscribers or Analytics on free
- Generating social assets on free

These modals make it easy to start the upgrade process with a link to billing.

## Using the Dashboard Effectively

- **Navigation:** The tabs (Smart Links, Email Subscribers, Promotions) are your main navigation on the dashboard. Click between them to switch contexts.

- **Responsive Design:** The dashboard is responsive, meaning it works on mobile, but for complex tasks like editing links or viewing large tables, a desktop or tablet is more comfortable.

- **Real-time Updates:** The app uses real-time capabilities in places. For instance, if you delete a smart link, it disappears from the list immediately without needing a page refresh. The promotions list auto-refreshes periodically.

In summary, the User Dashboard is where all the action happens: creating and managing smart links, launching promotion campaigns, and reviewing your fan data. It's designed to be intuitive and to surface the information you need at a glance. Spend some time exploring it â€“ click around on the different sections and familiarize yourself with the tools now at your disposal.
