# Spotify Playlist Campaigns

NotNoise's **Spotify Playlist Campaigns** feature (found under the **Playlist Promotions** tab in your dashboard) helps you promote your song to independent Spotify playlist curators. It's like hiring a campaign team to pitch your music to playlists, all managed through NotNoise's platform.

## How it Works

### Campaign Packages

NotNoise offers three campaign tiers: **Silver**, **Gold**, and **Platinum**, each with a set number of guaranteed playlist submissions and an estimated reach:

- **Silver Edition:** Submit to 20 playlists, reaching ~160k listeners.
- **Gold Edition:** Submit to 35 playlists, reaching ~280k listeners.
- **Platinum Edition:** Submit to 50 playlists, reaching ~400k listeners.

Each higher tier also includes more in-depth feedback and support. For example, Gold provides detailed song feedback and priority support, while Platinum adds a custom development plan and a next-release strategy consultation. Pro plan subscribers get a 20% discount on campaign prices (this is automatically applied in the pricing step).

### Launching a Campaign

On the **Playlist Promotions** dashboard, click **New Campaign**. A modal will guide you:

1. **Track Selection:** Search for your track on Spotify or paste a Spotify track link. NotNoise uses Spotify's API to retrieve your track's details (title, artist, artwork). Select the correct track from the results.
2. **Choose Plan:** Select Silver, Gold, or Platinum. You'll see the number of playlist submissions and features of each plan to help decide. If you have a Pro subscription, the plan's price will reflect your discount.
3. **Checkout:** Proceed to secure payment. NotNoise integrates with Stripe for payments. Upon confirming, you'll be redirected to a Stripe checkout page. After payment, you'll return to NotNoise.

### Campaign Progress

Once paid, your campaign status becomes "Active." The NotNoise team now gets to work: they will pitch your track to the promised number of playlist curators (20, 35, or 50 depending on plan). This process typically takes about 1-2 weeks as curators review your song.

In the **Playlist Promotions** section of your dashboard, you'll see a list of your campaigns and their statuses. Active campaigns are in progress; completed ones are marked delivered. You might also see a progress indicator or status messages like "Building momentum" or "Peak submission period" as your campaign advances.

<Note>
  The system auto-refreshes this list every 30 seconds to keep data up to date.

## Campaign Results

When a campaign is completed, its status changes to **Delivered** (meaning the campaign run is finished and results are ready). Now you can click **View Campaign Report** on that campaign in your dashboard. This opens a detailed results dashboard for that campaign.

### Campaign Results Dashboard

Here's what you'll find in a delivered campaign report:

- A summary of the campaign: your track's name and artist, the campaign package, and the completion date.

- **Overall Stats:** Total submissions (e.g. 35/35 submitted), how many curators approved (added your song) vs. declined, and an **approval rate** (percent of curators who added it). NotNoise also estimates the potential number of streams from the placements. For instance, it might show "Approved: 5" and "Est. Streams: 1250+" if 5 playlists added your track (assuming ~250 streams per playlist).

- **Key Takeaways (AI-Generated):** NotNoise uses AI to analyze curator feedback and highlights a few **Key Takeaways** – high-level conclusions about how your song was received. For example, a takeaway might be "Curators found the chorus very catchy" if that was common feedback.

- **Actionable Suggestions:** Along with takeaways, you get **Actionable Suggestions** for improvement or next steps. These could be creative tips (e.g., "Consider boosting the vocals in the mix for more impact") or marketing advice ("Engage with the curators who gave positive feedback"). These points are designed to help you on your next release.

- **Curator Feedback Table:** A table lists each curator or outlet that was pitched, whether they **Approved** or **Declined** your song, and any personal **Feedback** comments they gave. This transparency is valuable – you can see which playlists added the track and read any notes from curators (for example, reasons for passing on the track or compliments on the song). Approved entries are highlighted (with a green check icon and badge) and declined ones in red.

<Note>
  You do not need to manually contact any curators – the NotNoise team handles the pitching for you as part of the campaign. If for some reason a campaign doesn't get fully delivered (rare), reach out to NotNoise support.

The system marks campaigns awaiting internal review as **Awaiting Review** (an internal status indicating results have been uploaded by the team and are pending final checks), and then they finalize it to Delivered.
