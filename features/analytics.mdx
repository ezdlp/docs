# Analytics

Understanding how fans engage with your Smart Links is crucial. NotNoise provides **Advanced Analytics** for each Smart Link on the Pro plan. These analytics give you insight into your audience and the effectiveness of your marketing.

To access analytics, go to your dashboard's Smart Links list and click the bar chart **Analytics** icon next to a link (Pro users only). This will open the Analytics view for that specific Smart Link.

## Analytics Dashboard Overview

The Analytics Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into your Smart Link performance:

- **Total Views:** The number of unique visitors who have viewed your Smart Link page. NotNoise tracks unique sessions, so if the same fan visits multiple times in a short period, it counts as one unique view. This metric gives you an idea of how much traffic your link is getting.

- **Total Clicks:** The number of times fans clicked on any of your platform buttons (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) on that Smart Link. This indicates how many outbound clicks to streaming services were generated.

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** The ratio of clicks to views, expressed as a percentage. CTR tells you how effectively the Smart Link converts page viewers into listeners. For example, if you have 100 views and 50 clicks, that's a 50% CTR â€“ meaning half of visitors clicked through to a service. A higher CTR implies that the people who visit are interested in listening.

- **Email Subscribers:** If you enabled an email capture form on the link, this shows how many fans submitted their email via this Smart Link in the selected time frame.

## Time Frame Selection

At the top of the analytics dashboard, you can choose the analytics time window:
- Last 24 hours
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Custom period

The dashboard will update the stats accordingly. It also calculates comparisons to the previous period. For example, if you view "Last 7 Days," it will compare to the prior 7-day period and show percentage increase or decrease for each metric.

## Trends and Visual Data

- **Change Indicators:** Next to each key metric (views, clicks, CTR, subscribers) you'll see an arrow or percentage showing the trend compared to the previous period. For instance, "+20%" with an upward arrow on views means your traffic is 20% higher than the previous equivalent period.

- **Interactive Charts:** A chart plots your Views and Clicks over time (daily) for the selected range. This helps visualize spikes on certain days. For example, you might notice a big spike on release day or when you ran a promo on social media. The chart uses a timeline with tooltips so you can hover to see exact numbers on specific dates.

## Audience Insights

NotNoise provides valuable data about where your traffic is coming from and who your audience is:

- **Top Referral Sources:** NotNoise tracks where your Smart Link traffic is coming from. The analytics page breaks down referrals by source. Common sources include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X), TikTok, YouTube, and others â€“ basically if someone clicked your Smart Link from one of these apps or sites, NotNoise detects it. In the dashboard you'll see a list of top sources with icons (the Facebook "f", Instagram logo, etc.) and the number or percentage of views from each. For example, it might show "Instagram â€“ 45%" if nearly half your traffic came from the link in your Instagram bio or story.

- **Top Countries:** You can see where your listeners are located. NotNoise aggregates the country of each visitor (using geolocation by IP). The analytics view lists the top countries your Smart Link visitors come from, usually showing the top 5â€“6 countries with their flag emoji, country name, and percentage of total views. For instance, you might see ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States â€“ 40%, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom â€“ 10%, etc. This is super useful for understanding your audience demographics and can inform tour planning or targeted ads.

- **Device/Browser info:** NotNoise also collects device type and other info, but currently the main UI focus is on sources and countries. The **Globe** icon on the top stats indicates global reach, and there might be an icon for device breakdown if implemented (e.g., mobile vs desktop).

<Note>
  Analytics are only available to Pro plan users. If you're on the free plan, you will see a prompt to upgrade when trying to access analytics.

## Using Analytics for Marketing

These insights update in near real-time. As soon as fans interact with your link, the data is recorded. The dashboard may not auto-refresh every second, but you can refresh periodically or rely on the short caching (the data refreshes roughly every few minutes automatically).

Use these insights to gauge the effectiveness of your marketing. For example:

- If you notice most traffic comes from Instagram, you might double down on IG promotions.
- If your CTR is low, maybe the link placement or messaging can be improved to encourage more fans to click through.
- If you see spikes in traffic from specific countries, consider targeting those regions in your next release or tour planning.

The data is there to help you make informed decisions about your music marketing strategy.
