# Smart Links

**Smart Links** are shareable landing pages for your music releases. Each Smart Link aggregates all the different streaming platforms and purchase links for a song or album onto one page. Instead of juggling multiple URLs (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.), you share one Smart Link, and fans can choose their preferred service.

## Key Capabilities

- **Universal Music Links:** Add links to all major streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon, Deezer, Tidal, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, etc.). NotNoise fetches many of these automatically from an initial link (using the Odesli API), and you can manually add or edit any additional links.

- **Custom URL Slug:** Choose a memorable URL slug for each link (e.g. `my-new-release`) for easy sharing. NotNoise ensures each slug is unique and valid (letters, numbers, hyphens only).

- **Artwork and Info:** Upload cover artwork or provide an image URL. Enter the release title, artist name, and an optional description or subtitle to display on the landing page. This info makes the page attractive and informative.

- **Visual Customization:** Match your branding with appearance settings. You can set a primary highlight color (which applies to buttons and accents), and choose a background:
  - *Solid color:* Pick any background color.
  - *Gradient:* Choose two colors for a custom gradient.
  - *Image:* Provide a background image URL for a custom backdrop.

- **Fan Email Capture (Pro):** Optionally include a signup form so fans can submit their email address on the page (more in [Fan Email Capture](/features/email-capture)). The form can have a custom headline and message to encourage fans to subscribe.

- **Analytics Tracking:** All Smart Links automatically track visits and link clicks. If you're on the Pro plan, you can view detailed analytics for each link (see [Analytics](/features/analytics) section).

- **Facebook Pixel Integration (Pro):** You can embed a Meta/Facebook Pixel ID in your Smart Link settings. NotNoise will fire your specified Pixel events for page views and link clicks, so you can retarget fans on social media.

## Managing Smart Links

Once you create a Smart Link, it appears in your dashboard's Smart Links list. From there you can:

- **Share or Copy Link:** Copy the URL to share with fans. The dashboard provides a one-click copy button that copies the full URL (e.g. `https://notnoise.co/link/your-slug`) to your clipboard.

- **Edit Link:** Make changes by clicking the **Edit** icon. You can update the title, links, appearance, etc., at any time if you need to add a platform or change artwork.

- **View Analytics:** Click the **Analytics** (bar chart) icon to view detailed stats (Pro only). If you're on the free plan, clicking analytics will prompt you to upgrade.

- **Delete Link:** Remove a Smart Link if needed. Use the **Trash** icon and confirm deletion; NotNoise will remove the link from your account and it will no longer be accessible to others.

- **Generate Social Post Images (Pro):** Use the **Instagram** icon to create social media assets for this link (see [Social Media Asset Creation](/features/social-media-assets)). This is a Pro feature – if you're on free tier, the icon will be grayed out and prompt an upgrade.

## Fan Experience

When fans visit your Smart Link, they'll see a clean page with your release artwork at the top (and possibly your title/artist info depending on design), followed by a list of platform buttons. Each button is labeled (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) and clicking opens the corresponding app or website. 

Fans won't need to hunt for your music – everything is one click away. If you enabled the email form, it will appear below the platform buttons as a **"Get updates"** section where fans can subscribe to your mailing list.

<Note>
  On the Pro plan, you can hide the "Powered by NotNoise" branding on your Smart Link page for a more white-label look. By default, a small NotNoise logo and text appear at the bottom of the page; Pro users can toggle this off in their profile settings.
