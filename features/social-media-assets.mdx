# Social Media Asset Creation

NotNoise can automatically generate **Social Media Assets** – branded images optimized for sharing on platforms like Instagram – to help you promote your music. This feature creates eye-catching social media graphics that feature your cover art, artist name, title, and platform icons, styled in a way that's perfect for posts or stories.

## What It Does

Given your Smart Link information, NotNoise produces a high-quality image (PNG) that you can post on social media to drive traffic to your Smart Link. The image is sized appropriately (e.g. square 1080x1080 for Instagram posts, or vertical 1080x1920 for stories) and includes:

- Your release artwork (album/single cover)
- The release title and artist name, in an attractive font
- Icons of the music services available (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) – letting viewers know your music is on all those platforms
- The NotNoise color accents and branding in a subtle way (using your chosen primary color as well, so it feels cohesive with your link page)

## How to Use This Feature

On your dashboard in the Smart Links list, find the link you want to create a promo image for. Click the **Instagram icon** button on that Smart Link's card.

<Note>
  This is a Pro-only feature. If you're on the free tier, the Instagram icon will be greyed out and hovering on it will remind you it's a Pro feature.

When you click the icon:

1. If your smart link does not have cover artwork set, NotNoise will alert you (it needs an image to generate the graphic).

2. If everything is set, a **Social Card Preview** dialog opens. Here you can preview and configure the asset:
   - Choose format: **Post** (square 1:1) or **Story** (vertical 9:16)
   - Preview your design with your art, title, and platform icons
   - The background will use your Smart Link's primary color for consistency

3. Click **Generate**. NotNoise will render the image in high quality and save it. This may take a few seconds.

4. The finished image will open in a new tab automatically, or be ready for download. In most cases, it opens a new browser tab with the image (hosted via NotNoise's storage) – from there you can right-click and save it to your device.

5. The image is also stored in your account in case you need to retrieve it again.

## Benefits for Musicians

NotNoise's social asset generator saves you time fiddling with design tools. It ensures all the important info is on the graphic:

- **Visual Proof:** Platform logos show that your music is on Spotify, Apple Music, etc., increasing the chance people will click.

- **Consistent Branding:** It uses the same colors and art from your Smart Link, giving a professional, cohesive look across your promo materials.

- **High Resolution:** The assets are 1080x1080 for posts or 1080x1920 for stories, which are optimal resolutions for social sharing, so they'll appear crisp and attractive.

## Usage Tips

- Create social assets right before sharing your release on social media
- Use the story format for Instagram and Facebook stories, TikTok, or Snapchat
- Use the square post format for regular Instagram posts, Twitter/X, or Facebook
- In your social media caption, be sure to include your Smart Link URL so fans know where to click
- Consider creating assets for multiple Smart Links if you're promoting different releases

Remember, upgrading to Pro unlocks unlimited generation of social media images for all your smart links.
