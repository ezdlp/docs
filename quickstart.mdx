# Quick Start

Getting started with NotNoise is simple. This guide will walk you through creating your first Smart Link, which is the foundation of music promotion on our platform.

## Sign Up and Log In

Start by creating a NotNoise account and logging in. You'll be taken to your **User Dashboard**, which is the central hub for all features.

<Note>
  You can sign up using your email or through single sign-on with Google or Apple accounts.

## Create Your First Smart Link

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Smart Links">
    In the **Smart Links** section of your dashboard, click the **Create Smart Link** button in the top-right corner.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Your Release Details">
    You can search for your song by typing its name in the search field, or paste a streaming link (like Spotify) to auto-fill details. Alternatively, manually enter your release information:
    
    - **Title**: Your song or album title
    - **Artist**: Your artist name
    - **Cover Artwork**: Upload your artwork or provide an image URL
    - **URL Slug**: Choose a memorable slug for your link (e.g., `your-song-name`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Streaming Platforms">
    NotNoise will automatically fetch links from major streaming platforms if you provided a link in the previous step. Review the list of platforms and add any missing ones:
    
    - **Standard Platforms**: Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, etc.
    - **Additional Platforms**: SoundCloud, Bandcamp, etc.
    - **Social Links**: Add your social media profiles if desired
    
    <Tip>
      For maximum reach, include as many platforms as possible where your music is available.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize Appearance">
    Make your link match your branding:
    
    - **Accent Color**: Choose a primary color that complements your artwork
    - **Background Style**: Select from solid color, gradient, or image
    - **Preview**: Check how your Smart Link will look to fans using the preview pane
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Advanced Options (Optional)">
    If you're on the Pro plan, you can also enable:
    
    - **Email Capture**: Add a form to collect fan email addresses
    - **Meta Pixel**: Integrate a Facebook Pixel for ad tracking
    
    <Note>
      These features are only available on the Pro plan. You'll see upgrade prompts if you're on the free tier.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish and Share">
    Click the **Save** or **Publish** button to create your Smart Link. NotNoise will generate your unique URL (e.g., `notnoise.co/link/your-song-name`).
    
    Copy the link using the copy button and share it with your audience on social media, in your bio, or anywhere you promote your music.
